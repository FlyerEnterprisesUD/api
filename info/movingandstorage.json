    "info": "As one of the newer divisions Flyer Enterprises, Storage and Moving
    was established to solve the storage issues that students face during their
    summer months away from UD. In April of 2011, FE Storage launched its pilot
    program for Summer 2011, storing the belongings of the first 100 customers
    of this unique service. That pilot program offered students the option to
    purchase two different size boxes, either 3 cubic feet or 4.5 cubic feet.
    In addition to belongings stored in boxes, individuals also have the option
    to purchase storage space for items such as mini- fridges, futons, bean bag
    chairs, couches, tables, rugs, and other large items. Please visit our
    storefront here to view price listings. Feel free to direct any inquiries
    to FEStorage@flyerenterprises.com or (937)-687-8678",
